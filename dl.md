# Deep Learning on ROCm

## ROCm Tensorflow v1.10 Release
We are excited to announce the release of ROCm enabled TensorFlow v1.10 for AMD GPUs.

### Tensorflow Installation
First, you’ll need to install the open-source ROCm 1.9.0 stack. Details can be found here: https://rocm.github.io/ROCmInstall.html
Then, install these other relevant ROCm packages:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rocm-libs miopen-hip cxlactivitylogger
```
And finally, install TensorFlow itself (via the Python Package Index):
```
sudo apt install wget python3-pip
# Pip3 install the whl package from PyPI
pip3 install --user tensorflow-rocm
```
Now that Tensorflow v1.10 is installed!

### Tensorflow More Resources
Tensorflow docker images are also publicly available, more details can be found here:
https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/tensorflow/

Please connect with us for any questions, our official github repository is here:

## ROCm MIOpen v1.5 Release
Announcing our new Foundation for Deep Learning acceleration MIOpen 1.5 which introduces support for Convolution Neural Network (CNN) acceleration — built to run on top of the ROCm software stack!

### This release includes the following:

* [Layer fusion API](FusionGuide.md) for inference with convolution, bias, batch norm, and activation operators
* Deep Convolution Solvers optimized for both forward and backward propagation
* Optimized Convolutions including Winograd and FFT transformations
* Optimized GEMM’s for Deep Learning
* Pooling, Softmax, Activations, Gradient Algorithms Batch Normalization, and LR Normalization
* MIOpen describes data as 4-D tensors ‒ Tensors 4D NCHW format
* Support for OpenCL and HIP enabled frameworks API's
* MIOpen Driver enables the testing of forward/backward calls of any particular layer in MIOpen.
* Binary Package support for Ubuntu 16.04 and Fedora 24
* Source code at https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen
* Documentation
  * [MIOpen](https://rocmsoftwareplatform.github.io/MIOpen/doc/html/apireference.html)
  * [MIOpenGemm](https://rocmsoftwareplatform.github.io/MIOpenGEMM/doc/html/index.html)

## Porting from cuDNN to MIOpen

The [porting guide](https://github.com/dagamayank/ROCm.github.io/blob/master/doc/miopen_porting_guide.pdf) highlights the key differences between the current cuDNN and MIOpen APIs.

## The  ROCm 1.9 has prebuilt packages for MIOpen

Install the ROCm MIOpen implementation (assuming you already have the ‘rocm’  and ‘rocm-opencl-dev” package installed):

### For just OpenCL development  
```shell
sudo apt-get install miopengemm miopen-opencl
```   
### For HIP development
```shell
sudo apt-get install miopengemm miopen-hip
```     
### Or you can build from [source code](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen)
