            <h2>AMD Radeon Open Compute and Machine Intelligence:<br />Hardware and Software</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.microarch.org/micro51/Program/Workshop/index.html">Full-day Tutorial</a>
            <br /><b>Saturday, October 20, 2018</b>
            <br />Co-located with <a href="https://www.microarch.org/micro51/index.html">MICRO 51</a>
            <br />Fukuoka, Japan</h3>

            <p>This tutorial will provide in-depth coverage of AMD's GPU computing technology stack.
            We will discuss technical details of AMD's GPGPU hardware and software, as well as materials to enable computer architecture, computer systems, and application-level researchers to use AMD technologies in their research on high-performance compute architecture, GPU-accelerated computation, and machine learning.</p>
            <p>In particular, this tutorial will provide deep details of AMD's modern commercial GPU microarchitectures.
            Academic hardware researchers may find this information helpful in understanding how modern high-performance GPUs differ from typical GPUs modeled in academic simulators.
            Application developers and software researchers may be able to use this information to optimize their software's performance and test user- and kernel-level performance and power optimization techniques.</p>

            <p>This tutorial will also cover the <a href="https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm">Radeon Open Compute Platform (ROCm)</a>, AMD's <i>fully open-sourced</i> GPU-compute software stack.
            ROCm provides an exciting platform for academic researchers in computer architecture and systems to modify, customize, and otherwise pursue research in ways otherwise not possible without full access to the entire software stack.
            We will detail AMD's open source GPU drivers, compute runtimes, compilers, developer tools, and libraries.
            These details may be especially interesting to systems software researchers and programmers who want to optimize the software stack for their codes of interest.
            Hardware researchers may be interested to learn about the numerous parts of a commercial software stack that are rarely modeled in hardware simulations.</p>

            <p>Finally, we will cover AMD's library and software support for running popular machine learning frameworks on AMD GPUs.
            In particular, we will discuss the internals of AMD's <a href="https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen">MIOpen library</a> of high-performance machine intelligence kernels.
            We will describe how some of the high-performance kernels in this software are written to take advantage of many of the deep details of our GPU hardware and software that will be discussed earlier in this tutorial.
            In addition, we will discuss how MIOpen is being integrated into popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, and how academics can use and test this software.</p>
