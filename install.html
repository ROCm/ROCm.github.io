<h1>Are You Ready to ROCK!</h1>

<h2>The ROCm Install guide</h2>

<p>The ROCm Platform bringing a rich foundation to advanced computing by better intergrating the CPU and GPU to solve realworld problems.</p>

<p>On April 25th, 2016, we delivered ROCm 1.0 built around three core foundation elements:</p>

<li>Open Hetrogenous Computing Platform (Linux(R) Driver and Runtime Stack) optimized for HPC &amp; Ultra-scale class computing</li>
<li>Heterogeneous C and C++ Single Source to  better address the whole system computation not just a gpu device</li>
<li>HIP acknowledging the need for platform choice when utilizing GPU computing API</li>
<p>Using our knowledge of the HSA Standards and, more importantly, the HSA Runtime we have been able to successfully extended support to the dGPU with critical features for NUMA class acceleration. As a result, the ROCK driver is composed of several components based on our efforts to develop the Heterogeneous System Architecture for APUs, including the new AMDGPU driver, the Kernel Fusion Driver (KFD), the HSA+ Runtime and an LLVM based compilation stack for the building of key language support. This support starts with AMD’s Radeon R9 Fury, Radeon R9 Nano, Radeon R9 Fury X and FirePro S9300x2 dGPUs, but support is planned to expand to include future ASICS.</p>

Installing from AMD ROCm Repositories

AMD is hosting both debian and rpm repositories for the ROCm 1.1 packages. The packages in both repositories have been signed to ensure package integrity. Directions for each repository are given below:

Supported Operating Systems

The ROCm platform has been tested on the following operating systems:

Ubuntu 14.04.04
Fedora 23
There is experimental support for the following operating systems:

Ubuntu 16.04
Fedora 22
Debian repository - apt-get

Add the ROCm apt repository

For Debian based systems, like Ubuntu, configure the Debian ROCm repository as follows:

wget -qO - http://packages.amd.com/rocm/apt/debian/rocm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb [arch=amd64] http://packages.amd.com/rocm/apt/debian/ trusty main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list'
Install or Update

Next, update the apt-get repository list and install/update the rocm package:

Warning: Before proceeding, make sure to completely uninstall any pre-release ROCm packages:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rocm
Then, make the ROCm kernel your default kernel. If using grub2 as your bootloader, you can edit the GRUB_DEFAULT variable in the following file:

sudo vi /etc/default/grub
sudo update-grub
Once complete, reboot your system.

We recommend you verify your installation to make sure everything completed successfully.

Un-install

To un-install the entire rocm-dev development package execute:

sudo apt-get autoremove rocm
Installing development packages for cross compilation

It is often useful to develop and test on different systems. In this scenario, you may prefer to avoid installing the ROCm Kernel to your development system.

In this case, install the development subset of packages:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rocm-dev
Note: To execute ROCm enabled apps you will require a system with the full ROCm driver stack installed
Removing pre-release packages

If you installed any of the ROCm pre-release packages from github, they will need to be manually un-installed:

sudo apt-get purge libhsakmt
sudo apt-get purge radeon-firmware
sudo apt-get purge $(dpkg -l | grep 'kfd\|rocm' | grep linux | grep -v libc | awk '{print $2}')
If possible, we would recommend starting with a fresh OS install.

RPM repository - dnf (yum)

A dnf (yum) repostiory is also available for installation of rpm packages. To configure a system to use the ROCm rpm directory create the file /etc/yum.repos.d/rocm.repo with the following contents:

[remote]

name=ROCm Repo

baseurl=http://packages.amd.com/rocm/yum/rpm/

enabled=1

gpgcheck=0
Execute the following commands:

sudo dnf clean all
sudo dnf install rocm
As with the debian packages, it is possible to install rocm-dev or rocm-kernel individually. To uninstall the packages execute:

sudo dnf remove rocm
Verify Installation

To verify that the ROCm stack completed successfully you can execute to HSA vectory_copy sample application:

cd /opt/rocm/hsa/sample
make
./vector_copy
